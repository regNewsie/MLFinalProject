This project is a machine learning model to predict the amount of carbon emissions of data mining, given inputs of the date and the amount of electricity consumed.

This article talks about how the data was gathered and where I downloaded the dataset: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340922004541

The Data card and the Deon card are all in the gitHub (there is no link to Hugging face because I don't think hugging face is necessary to display the information)

There is no app for using an interface of putting in inputs because I could not figure out how to launch the app. There is a app.py file in the gitHub, though.

The spreadsheets that I used are also in the gitHub. BTC_Footprints_v1 is the original sheet while data_reduced_dimensionality is the dataset I used in the final machine learning model.

ML_project includes how to clean the dataset, the fianl cleaned dataset, and how I determined the random forest to be the best model to use.
