# Ethics DataCard for Forest Wildfire Prediction Model

## Dataset Overview
- **Input Variables**: Data, electricty consumption
- **Output Variables**: Estimated carbon consumption

## Data Collection Process
- Data sources include the national electricity consumption of UK and the date.
- Data is collected from public and licensed sources, ensuring proper consent and anonymization of any private information (e.g., personal property location).

## Bias Considerations
- **Potential Bias**: No biad: electricity bills are represented everywhere.
- **Mitigation**: Not applicable.

## Fairness & Justice
- Everyone should be equally represented in natioal data for electricyt comsumption .
- However, people outside of UK do not have data trained in the model

## Privacy and Security
- There is no personal data in one number of a national number

## Sustainability and Environmental Impact
- The model aims to assist in informing people of the amount of carbon emissions if doing data mining.

## Model Limitations
- The model's accuracy is limited to the UK.
- The model is updated to include modern data.

## Accountability and Transparency
- The development team will monitor the model for performance over time, ensuring that it is still correctly correlating with carbon emissions.
- Stakeholders (e.g. local government) will be informed of the modelâ€™s limitations, ensuring proper interpretation of the predictions.
- False predictions will be communicated to stakeholders, with a process in place for continuous feedback and model improvement.

## Societal Impact
- The model is designed to protect both human lives and the environment by enabling better planning and response to wildfire threats.
- It has the potential to inform policy changes in land management, conservation, and emergency response strategies.
