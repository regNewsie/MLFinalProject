# Ethics Checklist for Carbon Emissions of Data Mining

## 1. Data Collection
- **Input Variables**: Date, the average electricity concumption
- **Output Variables**: the carbon emmisions
- Are the data sourceslegally available?

The data is legally avaliable! all sources are cited in the article and are public.
- Has any sensitive information, such as private property or personal location data, been anonymized?

There is no sensitive information. All there is numbers, which can't be attributed to a person with what they currently have.
- Have you obtained consent for data collected from private or proprietary sources, such as satellite imagery or drone footage?
I haven't collected the data, but all of the information gathered is stated to be publicly avaliable by the governemnt, and the numbers gathered are just power information, and formulas applied to find the carbon comsumption.

## 2. Fairness & Justice
- How will you ensure that the model’s predictions are fair and do not disproportionately affect specific regions or communities (e.g., indigenous lands, rural areas)?

The predictions are fair by overestimating the amount of carbon emitted. 
- What biases might exist in the historical data, and how will you address these to ensure the model does not unfairly target or neglect specific areas?

There shouldn't be biaqsed data. however, all of the data is gathered in the UK, so the data could only be applicable in that region.
- How will you balance fairness in handling both false positives and false negatives?

Threre shouldn't be any false positives and negatives. The data gathered is completely representative of what the region (because electricity consumption can't be lied about), and what is predicted is just the truth.
- Have you tested the model across different regions to ensure consistent performance across various regions?
No, the model only could be applicable to the Uk because that is where all of the data is gathered. The model could only be used in that area because all other data is extrapolated and could not be used.

## 3. Transparency
- How will you ensure transparency about the data sources, algorithms, and decision-making process of the model?

The data sourse id fully documented in the article, and we state that teh random forest model used is fairly common and non intrusive.
- What information will you make available to government agencies and the public?

The dataset is fully public with regards to how the data was gathered and the code is avaliable fully commented.
- How will you communicate the model’s predictions and limitations to decision-makers so that they understand the risks involved?

I state that all of the data is only in the UK, and using inputs outside of the UK region will cause in data that would be incorrect.
- How will you explain false positives and false negatives to the affected communities or stakeholders?

False positives will never happen, as I stated the reason previouly

## 4. Privacy
- How will you ensure the privacy of individuals whose data might be inadvertently captured?

There is no identifying individual information. All of the info gathered is just about the nation's data, and no individuals are captured in that.
- What steps will you take to prevent the misuse of this data, especially in terms of tracking human activities in forest areas without their consent?

Not applicable, the data is fully anonimized.


## 5. Accountability
- Who will be held accountable if the model incorrectly predicts carbon emissions?

I would be at fault, but we can cross check with other sources to see if carbon was correctly prediced.
- What system will you establish to monitor and adjust the model over time, ensuring it adapts to changing environmental and climate conditions?

Electricity data is gathered over time, so the dataset could be updated as time goes on and the ML model could be retrained on the new data.
- How will you communicate accountability measures to the public?

If the model incorrectly predicts carbon emissions, I will state the model used. No one should be hurt however, so it is alright in the end i suppose.

## 6. Inclusivity
- How will you ensure the model includes diverse data from different types of forests regions?

Next time, I'll find data that also include other electricity data from other places other than the UK.
- How will you ensure the model accounts for the needs of different communities, including vulnerable populations such as indigenous groups or rural residents who have unique relationships with the land?

Electricity bills shoould include indigious people in the UK, so that question is not applicable for this project.
- If certain regions or communities lack sufficient data (e.g., underreporting, lack of resources), how will you address this to avoid biased predictions?

Every part of teh UK should be represented. There are no methods that are wrong in the data colleciton.

## 7. Sustainability
- How will the model’s predictions affect carbon emissions management stratigies?

This should alert people to how much carbon emissions are present, and this data could also start the government to make restrictions on bitcoin mining.
- How will you ensure the model remains sustainable, considering the evolving nature of climate change?

This model could be updated with time to include current electricity costs and the resulting carbon emissions.
- What are the broader social and environmental implications if this model becomes widely adopted?

If this model is adopted, people would know the harm of the enviornment they are producing by mining bitcoin.
